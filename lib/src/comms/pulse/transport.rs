//! Transport boundary for Pulse — the byte seam between the protocol layer and the ENet driver.
//! Ported from bevy-explorer `crates/comms/src/pulse/transport.rs` @ 3f65c164 (WebTransport
//! support and the cross-realm warm-socket `presence` gate dropped: this client tears the room
//! down on realm change, like every other comms room).
//!
//! The driver knows nothing about protobuf, identity, the decoder, or the parcel grid. Its whole
//! contract is: connect to `host:port`, then move bytes between two channels — outbound
//! [`PulseFrame`]s (with a reliability tag the driver maps to ENet channels) and inbound raw
//! `ServerMessage` bytes — and report [`PulseStatus`]. Because the seam is bytes, everything
//! above it (handshake, decode, state machine) is testable with in-memory channels, no sockets.
